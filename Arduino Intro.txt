Note: I didn't have enough of the flexible wires to give you, but the
flat colored ones will work and are actually kinda better bc they won't jiggle
loose while you are tinkering with the other stuff! Double check
all the wiring against the diagrams before you connect the circuit, and never
add/remove components while it is plugged in and powered on! You won't get shocked
or anything but there is a small chance the board could get fried. If it does,
not worries, it was like 3 dollars lol. Have fun! <3
